# Password Strength and Security Evaluation Report

This repository contains the deliverables for a security assignment focused on understanding and evaluating **password complexity** and researching **common attack vectors**.

## Project Goal
The primary objective was to empirically test various password constructions using a strength checker tool, identify the critical factors that contribute to a high security rating, and investigate the modern methods used by attackers to compromise user credentials.

## Deliverables

The full report and supporting evidence are provided in the following files:

### 1. **Final Report**
The complete analysis, methodology, results, and security recommendations are detailed in the main document.

* **File:** `Password_Strength_Evaluation_Report.pdf`

### 2. **Key Findings**
The evaluation confirmed that **length and character variety** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) are the definitive measures of strength. The report specifically demonstrates how an 8-character, low-complexity password scored **37% (Weak)**, while a comparable 11-character, high-complexity password achieved **100% (Very Strong)**.

### 3. **Attack Research**
The report includes an overview of common password compromise methods, moving beyond traditional **Brute Force** and **Dictionary Attacks** to cover modern threats such as:
* **Credential Stuffing** (exploiting password reuse).
* **Phishing** (social engineering to steal credentials).
* **Keylogger Attacks** (malware that records keystrokes).

## Evidence

Screenshots validating the strength checker results for the three test cases are located in the `screenshots/` directory.
